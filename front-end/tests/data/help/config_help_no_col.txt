Available configuration options:

wrap_column <unsigned integer> (default: 120)
  Target line length before wrapping

begin_style [ auto | always_wrap ] (default: auto)
  Places the `begin` after control flow statements (e.g. `if`).
  If "always_wrap", the `begin` will always be placed on the next line
  at the same indentation as the statement it is within.

format_multiline_strings <boolean> (default: true)
  Whether to format the inside of multiline strings.
  When enabled, the leading whitespace of internal lines will be rewritten to
  match that of the starting quote, and internal line terminators will be
  normalised. Trailing whitespace is preserved, however.

encoding native | <NAME> (default: native)
  The encoding to use when reading and writing files.
  If "native":
    * on Windows, the system ANSI codepage is used
    * otherwise, UTF-8 is used
  
  In all cases a detected BOM will override the configured encoding.

use_tabs <boolean> (default: false)
  Use tab characters for indentation

tab_width <unsigned integer> (default: 2)
  Number of spaces per indentation (ignored if use_tabs=true)

continuation_indents <unsigned integer> (default: 2)
  Width of continuations, measured as a multiple of the configured indentation.
  Continuations are used to further indent the wrapped lines from a "logical line".
  Indentations are used to indent the base of a "logical line".

line_ending [ lf | crlf | native ] (default: native)
  Line ending character sequence.
  If "native":
    * on Windows, "crlf" is used
    * otherwise, "lf" is used
