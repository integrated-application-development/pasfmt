Usage: pasfmt [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...

Arguments:
  [PATHS]...
          Paths that will be formatted. Can be a path/dir/glob. If no paths are specified, stdin is
          read

Options:
  -f, --files-from <FILES_FROM>
          A file containing paths to operate on. Newline separated list of path/dir/glob

      --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>
          Override the configuration file. By default working directory will be traversed until a
          `pasfmt.toml` file is found

  -C <KEY=VALUE>
          Override one configuration option using KEY=VALUE. This takes precedence over
          `--config-file`.
          
          To list available options, use `-C help`.

  -m, --mode <MODE>
          The mode of operation
          
          The default is `files`, unless data is being read from stdin, in which case the default is
          `stdout`.
          
          When the mode is `stdout` and data is being read from files, all output is concatenated in
          a human-readable format.

          Possible values:
          - files:  format files in-place
          - stdout: print formatted files to stdout
          - check:  exit zero if input is formatted correctly, otherwise exit non-zero and list the
            erroneous files

      --cursor <CURSOR>...
          Print (to stderr) where cursors at the given UTF-8 byte positions move to after formatting
          
          Cursors provided can be comma-separated. After formatting, a single line of the form
          `CURSOR=<LIST>` will be printed to stderr, where `<LIST>` is a comma-separated list of the
          new UTF-8 byte positions for the input positions. The order of this list matches the
          provided order of the cursors.

  -v, --verbose...
          Increase logging verbosity (can be repeated)

  -l, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Only show log messages at least this severe
          
          [default: WARN]
          [possible values: OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
